# 🎧 Sebastián Escobar Pajoy — Audio Developer & DSP Engineer

I am a freelance **audio developer** and **sound engineer** with a focus on:

* Development and prototyping of audio effect plugins
* Design of acoustic measurement and calibration tools
* Research and experimentation in signal processing and machine learning applied to sound

## 🎛️ Plugin Development & Prototyping

I build custom audio plugins and synthetizers for real-time sound manipulation using C++ (JUCE). My experience includes flanger, equalizer, metering tools, aimed at both creative and professional audio environments.

## 🧠 Research & Signal Processing

I work on research projects related to:

* Audio signal classification
* Feature extraction (spectral descriptors, temporal features)
* AI applied to sound
